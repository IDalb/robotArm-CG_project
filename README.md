## Overview and aim
The *Robotic Arm project* is a school project revolving around the themes of Robotics and Computer Graphics.  
The main goal of this project is to create a 3D 5-joint robotic arm that can move around using the *Unity* game engine.

Each joint needs the ability to move along its degree of freedom thanks to a slider.

Eventually, the arm should be able to trace lines, circles and letters around its base.
